Dia Al-Azzawi 
(born Baghdad,1939)
Mu‘allaqa of al-Harith bin Hilza, 1980
‘When we strained on our camels from the palm trees of El-Bahrain, till El-Hisa brought them to their goal, then we swerved against Tameem…’
The Mu‘allaqat, ‘hanging poems’ were reputed to have been suspended on the walls of the Ka‘ba at Makkah in the era before Islam. The verses evoke the landscapes of Ancient Arabia and a life of constant movement.
Azzawi began his studies as an archaeologist before turning to art, and studied at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, graduating in 1962. Working across different mediums from painting to sculpture and artists’ books, Azzawi’s work celebrates Arab culture, blurring the boundaries between artforms and amalgamating images and text. 

Like many of his Iraqi contemporaries he sees his work as part of a continuum that links the artistic production of Iraq from ancient times to the present. His deep love of poetry extends from the Mu‘allaqat to contemporary poets from across the Arab world. In this work, the text of the Mu‘allaqah of the poet al-Harith acts as the backdrop to the vibrant unfolding scene described in the poem.
